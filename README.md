# Pokemon Frontend Coding Challenge

This is a coding challenge for a frontend position at prepend. The goal is to build a web application that allows users to browse and discover Pokemon. The application should list all Pokemon, show details for a selected Pokemon, and allow pagination and searching.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>`.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the development server using `npm run dev`.
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features

The application includes the following features:

- List all Pokemon with a short summary of each on the root page of the application. Displays the name and the image of the Pokemon.
- Shows details of a Pokemon when a user clicks on it. Displays species, stats, types, weight, and moves.
- Pagination to display a maximum of 16 Pokemon at once.

## Technologies Used

The application is built using the following technologies:

- React.js
- TypeScript
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS

### Note:
Unfortunately, the API used for this project does not provide an endpoint for searching through Pokemons. So search functionality could not be implemented.
